# Language-Analytics-Assignment-2

Here is the code for my submission for Language Analytics assignment 2:

To run the code, you should download the .py-file in this repository. I use the "100_english_novels"-corpus so there is no need to download any data. This can be done manually by going through the following steps:

1: Open the "collocation.py"-file in this repository.

2: Press "Raw" in the top right corner

3: Save the file as a .py-file (windows: ctrl + s // mac: cmd + s)

4: Place the file in your src-folder.

To run the script you should do the following:

1: Open a terminal in your Jupyter hub.

2: set your working directory to src by typing the following: "cd cds-language/src" (without quotations).

3: Then type: "python3 collocation.py ../data/100_english_novels/corpus {your_keyword} {your_window_size}" with your own keyword and window_size (without quotations and brackets).

4: After running the script there should be a .csv-file in your src-folder.
